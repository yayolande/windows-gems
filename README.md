## Flutter install

Flutter install is quite troublesome when you dont know it. The problem is that you have to install too many additional packages besides the one available on the flutter web site.
Not only "flutter doctor" will be your friend in this stage, but also all items shown are not essential.
For instance, "Visual Studio - develop for Windows" section as the name imply is only useful in the event you will develop Windows app with flutter.
Similarly, "Android Studio" is essential for android app. "Chrome - develop for the web" is need for web development. I think you get the gist of it.
If "Visual Studio - develop for Windows" error persist, you need to install VS and [install additional features](https://bleepcoder.com/flutter/517809676/visual-studio-is-missing-necessary-components).
Besides those specific errors, the rest can solved following properly the documentation to the end and reading thoroughly the error/warning message provided by "flutter doctor".
